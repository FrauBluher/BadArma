# BadArma

![](http://i.imgur.com/w8qf8sB.jpg)

Collection of scripts and mission templates for use with in-house badgame Arma 3 modset.

##TO DO:
  * Remove stuff from F3 that are not needed  
   * Spectator - finalizing  
   * Anything else we have a mod for and don't need  
  * Less reliance on parameters and instead extend the the gear init to include the backpack variable (similar to   hedgehoggers modified scripts)  
  * Change from a faction based system to a side based one to simplify things  
  * Maybe change to using descripion.ext to define which loadouts to use for which side??

  * Custom team insignia images?
