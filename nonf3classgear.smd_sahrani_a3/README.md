Set faction loadouts in decsription.ext with inheritance.

gear_usarmywd_ucp.h is a good example. might be a better way to change the uniforms on each class, but it shows how you can inherit from an identically named class in the superclass

check comments in assigngear.sqf and weapon_random_example.h for details on randomization

###to do
- integrate with f3
- separate weapons config / class ???
- random selection if provided array of uniforms, weapons, etc
- write full faction loadouts as needed
